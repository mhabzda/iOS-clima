#  Clima

This is a simple app that shows current weather conditions for the city user inputs. It also has a functinality to get the weather in the current user's location. [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) is used.

In order to be able to use the app, you need to create [Open Weather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in) account and generate a token. It needs to be pasted into the [TokenProvider.swift](Clima/Model/TokenProvider.swift) file.
